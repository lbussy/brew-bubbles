# TODO List

## Open

- Add Thingspeak support
- Check shouldSaveConfig behavior in WiFi()
- Move posting targets to async
- Maybe optimize settings update with the ArduinoJson-based struct?
- Optimize /bubble with JSON struct
- Change so that posting configuration changes is not a complete page reload
- See if we can do something about entering a bad password on portal
