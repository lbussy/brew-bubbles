Brew Bubbles Documentation
==========================

This documentation is absolutely a work in progress, in that I depend on *you* to help me make sure it is relevant and easy to read.  *I* know how to work with Brew Bubbles.  My goal is to make you an expert too.  Anything that is confusing is a bug and I want to know about it, please.

For spelling/grammatical errors, or if you would like to improve the documentation, please feel free to issue a pull request with the update.  For technical issues with the documentation, please  `open an issue on GitHub`_.
