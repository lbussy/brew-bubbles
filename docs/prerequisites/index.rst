Project Prerequisites
=====================

To use Brew Bubbles, you need to use an S-lock type fermentation lock. These locks are inexpensive and readily available. There are always discussions about the ability to clean these locks. Itâ€™s my experience that a warm soap and water soak followed by a good rinse handles the nasties. If you use a liquid such as Everclear or cheap Vodka in it, there are no worries about sucking germs back into your brew.  For the price, you could replace them every few brews.

These are not perfect airlocks. I would have preferred to devise a way to use the three-piece airlocks; however, in testing, these proved to be exceedingly dependant upon the airlock fill level to work reliably.

If you use a blowoff-tube, obviously you would remove that and replace it with the S-lock when blowoff danger has subsided. I have also had excellent results using FermCap-S and not needing a blowoff tube. FermCap-S works excellent in the boil too.

On top of the S-lock, you need an ESP8266 controller and some other parts detailed in the Device Assembly page.

Add a tiny bit of time and some skill which you can pick up making a couple of these devices, and you have yourself an easy to make, low-cost, and rewarding DIY homebrew project.
