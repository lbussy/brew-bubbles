# Gerber Files

I generated these files using a script provided by [JLPCB](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/43-how-to-export-eagle-pcb-to-gerber-files).  I have never had boards created from this process, so you are using these at your own risk.

These files were generated on 11/25/20 @ 08:08 CT from the master branch.  Please pay attention to the date/time on the originals to ensure they are up to date.
