# Brew Bubbles Shield

This folder contains the Eagle files for printed circuit boards supporting [Brew Bubbles](https://www.brewbubbles.com/).

The shield provides the necessary component connections and circuitry for the ESP-8266 controller used in this project.  It is nearly identical in size to the Wemos D1 mini we use to provide a very compact and lightweight footprint.

Please see [the documentation](https://docs.brewbubbles.com) for information about ordering PCBs or components listings.
